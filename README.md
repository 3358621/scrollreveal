#### Installation

The simplest method is to copy paste this snippet just before your closing `</body>` tag.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/scrollreveal@3.3.2/dist/scrollreveal.min.js"></script>
```

But you can also:

- [Download ZIP](https://github.com/jlmakes/scrollreveal.js/archive/master.zip)
- `npm install scrollreveal`
- `bower install scrollreveal`

#### The Basics

The `reveal()` method is the primary API, and makes it easy to create and manage various types of animations.

```html
<!-- HTML -->
<div class="foo"> Foo </div>
<div class="bar"> Bar </div>
```
```js
// JavaScript
window.sr = ScrollReveal();
sr.reveal('.foo');
sr.reveal('.bar');
```
